**Project Description:**
This program is meant to be a student grade manager. If you have a lot of student grades you need to keep track of, this system is your solution because it lets you add students to a record, delete students from a record, adjust student grades, and keep track of their majors. This program can save you a lot of time if you manually keep track of your student's grades.
